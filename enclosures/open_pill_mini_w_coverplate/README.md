## The Open Pill Mini w/ Coverplate Enclosure

The "Open Pill Mini w/ Coverplate" was designed as an attempt to incorporate the best of the "Orange Pill" and the "Open Pill" enclosures into a single design. It is fully enclosed for improved aesthetics and protection of electronic components, yet is compact and can be manufactured with a simple FDM printer, also not requiring any additional hardware components. A first for this enclosure was preventing access to the SeedSigner's data-enabled USB port as an additional security assurance for users.
