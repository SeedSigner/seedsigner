## The Open Pill Enclosure

The "Open Pill" was the second officially released SeedSigner enclosure. Given some of the challenges associated with the "Orange Pill", the Open Pill was designed for quick, inexpensive, and simple deployment. No secondary hardware components are required for assembly and the design consists of a single printed part that can be produced with even basic 3D printers. This simpler design was intended to put the focus back on the project's software, which was improving by leaps and bounds when the enclosure was released.

### Comfortable Controls Optional Upgrade:
The bare joystick on an open pill or open pill mini design can be uncomfortable for some thumbs. Twitter user @Vulcan21com developed a DIY solution to add comfort to the exposed joystick using a M2.5 knurled nut standardized under DIN 466, widely available at many hardware stores. The joystick itself has no threading, but it is possible to screw the M2.5 nut onto the joystick with a bit of precision and patience. While screwing it on for the first time it will cut a light thread into the plastic. Be gentle as to not transfer too much torque into the joystick. The result will look like this:
