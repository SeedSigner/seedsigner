## The Orange Pill Enclosure

The "Orange Pill" was the first SeedSigner enclosure. It's eye-catching design is the enclosure most commonly associated with the SeedSigner project for many. While aesthetically appealing and fun to showcase to others, the thumbstick topper's sub-optimal design, the need for secondary hardware components, and other drawbacks make this enclosure a less desirable choice for every day SeedSigner use.
