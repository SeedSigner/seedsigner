## Passphrase Considerations

As of writing this document, passphrase length has not been standardized across software/hardware wallets.

SeedSigner does not impose a passphrase length limit, to accomodate recovery of seeds created on alternate platforms with large or unbounded passphrase lengths.

When creating a seed with a passphrase on SeedSigner, consider whether or not you intend to recover your seed on a wallet or signing device other than SeedSigner, and act accordingly. 

Below are a list of passphrase length limits imposed by various hardware/software wallets and signing devices:

| Wallet       | Max Passphrase Length |
|--------------|------------------------|
| ColdCard     | 100              |
| BitBox02      | 149         |
| Cobo/Keystone | 128 |
| Trezor | 50 |
| Jade | 100 |
| Specter DIY | NO LIMIT |
| SeedSigner | NO LIMIT |
